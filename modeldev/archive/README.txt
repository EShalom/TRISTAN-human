and collected before data acquisition was complete. Data were segmented by bioxydyn with one of the cases repeated in Sheffield (v4)

data_v1 is the same data (bioxydyn segmentations only) organised for batch analysis into baseline and rifampicin folders

results_v1 is the result of the original batch analysis script.
